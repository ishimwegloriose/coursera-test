		For this assignment, you are to use Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework as much as possible.
		I suggest you start with copying the starter bootstrap files and folders we discussed in Lecture 25 part 2. 
		If you've cloned/downloaded the code example repository, it should be in the examples/Lecture25 folder.
		Copy the contents of examples/Lecture25 to your solution container folder (e.g., module3-solution) as a starting point.
		Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take up the entire width of the browser window (minus some margins, of course)
		for all views: desktop, tablet, and mobile. To make the section really tall, you can either fill it out with a LOT of text or simply set its height to 
		something like 1000px. It needs to be tall enough to cause scrolling down to be required to view the bottom of the section. Make sure its background color
		is set to distinguish it from the rest of the content. (Hint: don't forget to have an element with a class='container' or class='container-fluid' wrapping your grid. </p>
      </div>
